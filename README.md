# TGist Taxonomy Creator

Simplistic and unfinished code that creates a taxonomy from a list of terms, their features and relations between those terms.

Dependencies:

- The object exploration code by Dimitris Andreou (https://github.com/DimitrisAndreou/memory-measurer). Make sure that the following jars are in your classpath: `dist/objectexplorer.jar`, `lib/guava-r09.jar` and `lib/jsr305.jar`. This code is used for debugging purposes only and technically you will not need this code when you check out the master branch of this repository.
